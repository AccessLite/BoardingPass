<p>Consider all of the following before you decide you'd like to participate. I will be guiding you through a 4-week long project that is going to demand your attention on a daily basis. You will have two leaders: the technical lead and the project manager. I will be assuming both roles and you must treat them separately. </p>

<h3>
<a id="guidelines" class="anchor" href="#guidelines" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Guidelines:</h3>

<ol>
<li>You must complete the project in the allotted time. Failure to do so will disqualify you from continuing the project in the coming weeks. </li>
<li>You must have a daily check-in with me via slack to discuss your prior day's progress in addition to what you plan on doing on the current day.</li>
<li>Your code must be clear and follow my guidelines. </li>
<li>You must be available via screen sharing if you need my assistance in paired programming. </li>
<li>Do not ask your tech lead a question you haven't already googled. </li>
<li>Commit messages must be (at least) minimally descriptive.</li>
<li>You cannot work on the project during Access Code hours. </li>
<li>If you cannot solve your problem after googling it, prepare a specific question for your tech lead. </li>
<li>Your tech lead has final say on implementation. You are free to disagree, as long as you can back your code with fact. </li>
<li>Your project manager has final say on timing &amp; design. You are free to disagree, as long as you can defend your changes. </li>
<li>Tech lead will provided some scaffolding for your code, but you will be responsible for the rest. </li>
<li>Log all of you bugs before the end of each day.</li>
