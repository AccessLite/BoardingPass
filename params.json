  "body": "### FoaaS: Intro\r\n\r\nConsider all of the following before you decide you'd like to participate. I will be guiding you through a 4-week long project that is going to demand your attention on a daily basis. You will have two leaders: the technical lead and the project manager. I will be assuming both roles and you must treat them separately. \r\n\r\n### Guidelines:\r\n1. You must complete the project in the allotted time. Failure to do so will disqualify you from continuing the project in the coming weeks. \r\n2. You must have a daily check-in with me via slack to discuss your prior day's progress in addition to what you plan on doing on the current day.\r\n3. Your code must be clear and follow my guidelines. \r\n4. You must be available via screen sharing if you need my assistance in paired programming. \r\n5. Do not ask your tech lead a question you haven't already googled. \r\n6. Commit messages must be (at least) minimally descriptive.\r\n7. You cannot work on the project during Access Code hours. \r\n8. If you cannot solve your problem after googling it, prepare a specific question for your tech lead. \r\n9. Your tech lead has final say on implementation. You are free to disagree, as long as you can back your code with fact. \r\n10. Your project manager has final say on timing & design. You are free to disagree, as long as you can defend your changes. \r\n11. Tech lead will provided some scaffolding for your code, but you will be responsible for the rest. \r\n12. Log all of you bugs before the end of each day.\r\n",
