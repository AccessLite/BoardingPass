# Welcome (Read Me. Like, right meow.)

### Most Important Thing to Note:
__If you do not finish the project to spec at the "hard" deadline of 11pm Monday of each week, you may not proceed with the project.__

There are consequences for not finishing a sprint on time and so, being removed from the project will be yours. You are free to continue the project on your own time, but you will not be participating in the discussions on Slack, your lists will be removed from Trello, and you will not have your PR's looked over. 

You *will* have the opportunity to join the activities again in the next project cycle (*likely 4+ weeks*). 

Everyone participating will (at the very least) have their project reviewed at the 1 week mark.  

### General 
1. Read through the guidelines again if you haven't. Pay careful attention to all of them.
2. Daily check-ins will be automated. You must follow through on them starting Wednesday. 

### Procedure
1. Create a new repo under the AccessLite organization. 
2. Name your repo `BYT-<yourGithubName>`, replacing `<yourGithubName>` with your github name.
3. Read BOTH the tech lead info and the PM info before you begin to get a sense of the project. 
4. It will not be overly difficult the first week, but time will be a factor. 
5. The following 2-3 weeks will have a marked increase in difficulty. 

### Trello
1. Trello is used primarily to keep track of your work: for yourself, your tech lead and your PM. UPDATE IT DAILY. 
2. This is what you must do: 
  1. There are three lists you must copy for yourself: "Week 1 MVP (Master)", "Week 1 MVP (Completed)", and "Week 1 MVP (In Progress" 
   2. To copy them, select the "..." at the corner of the list, and select "Copy"
   3. Add your name to the end of the list name to differentiate your list from someone else's
   4. Arrange your lists so that your three are right next to each other (order should be: Master, In Progress, Completed)
   5. When you start on a task, move it into your own "In Progress" list. I will be checking in on the board from time to time. When you finish a task "In Progress", move it to "Completed"
3. ALL TASKS HAVE DUE DATES!!! Please make note of them.
  1. These due dates are all "soft" deadlines, meaning, the task *should* be completed by that time. But there are no penalties if you don't. 
  2. Though, as described above, there is one "hard" deadline: MONDAY, NOV 28th @ 11pm. Your app must be to spec and you must have a PR submitted before 11pm.
