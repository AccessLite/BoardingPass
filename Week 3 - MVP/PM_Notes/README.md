# Week 3 MVP - Project Manager Notes
---

### All hail our new leader, Material Design. 

This week's overall goal will be mostly UI/UX-focused. We have a nearly fully working app at this point, we just want to ensure that the experience in using it is plesant for our users. We that in mind, we're making a seismic shift towards using Material Design to improve the app's look and feel. 

### What is Material Design?

It's a design guide put together by Google covering every single UI/UX element and aspect of an app. We don't need to adhere to all of the guidelines they put forth, but they are usually very good guiding rules in how to design an app with a compelling user experience. 

Material design's details are extensive, and we're just going to focus on a few elements: colors, fonts, layout, buttons, shadows, gestures, and minor animations.

### Color: Purple Palette & Teal Accent

In material design, it's suggested that you use three colors from a primary palette along with a single, accent color from a secondary palette. The accent color is mostly used to denote some sort of action or interaction. Here's a screenshot of our main color palette for this app:

To get the proper values of the colors, see [Colors](https://material.google.com/style/color.html). The TechLead will fill you in on how to properly manage the color palettes, but we also eventually want to give people the ability to "download" additional color options - maybe some paid, some free.
